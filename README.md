=================

A playground to experiement [NWjs][1] and web technology.

 - P2P with [webtorrent][2] experiment, [try it here][ex2]

This has a live example of file sharing.

```
npm install webtorrent
```


### Node

 - This `webtorrent-hybrid` is needed in Node environment

```
npm install webtorrent-hybrid
```

The API are same as `webtorrent`, so only difference would be to call `require('webtorrent-hybrid')` instead of `require('webtorrent')`.
